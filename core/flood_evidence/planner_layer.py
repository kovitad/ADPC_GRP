"""Live reported flooding for one Planner area (ADR-0056, step 2 and W7b).

Read-only. Incidents carry their district codes from the worker (step 1), and facility exposure
is stored by the worker, so roads and facilities need no spatial work here. Cameras near the
district's incident roads are matched in the request, as the pilot's incident page already does
(at most about 20 incidents times 1,413 cameras).

A sub-district contains only incidents whose worker-stored sub-district codes include it, and
facility/camera points inside its outline; the parent-district totals are returned alongside.
Officer checks and officer-confirmed access are not included (decision D2 is open). Nothing here
touches an assessment.
